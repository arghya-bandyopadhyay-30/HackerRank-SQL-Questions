# Star Pattern P(R) Generator

This document explains how to generate the star pattern `P(R)` using a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL. The query builds a triangular star pattern with `R` rows, where the number of stars increases with each row.

---

## Overview
The pattern is constructed as follows:
- **Row 1:** Contains 1 star.
- **Row 2:** Contains 2 stars.
- **Row 3:** Contains 3 stars.
- **...**
- **Row R:** Contains R stars.

### Example Output for R = 5:
```plaintext
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

## SQL Query
### Full Query
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE starpattern AS (
    SELECT
        1 AS level,
        CAST(REPEAT('* ', 1) AS CHAR(1000)) AS stars
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        level + 1,
        REPEAT('* ', level + 1) AS stars
    FROM
        starpattern
    WHERE
        level < 20
)
SELECT
    stars
FROM
    starpattern;
```

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Step 1: Define the Base Case
The base case initializes the recursive CTE with the first row:
```sql
SELECT
    1 AS level,
    CAST(REPEAT('* ', 1) AS CHAR(1000)) AS stars
```
- **`level`:** Indicates the row number (starts at 1).
- **`REPEAT('* ', 1)`:** Generates the string of stars for the first row.
- **`CAST(... AS CHAR(1000))`:** Ensures the data type can handle large strings for higher levels.

### Step 2: Recursive Step
The recursive query generates subsequent rows by incrementing the `level` and adding one more star to the pattern:
```sql
UNION ALL
SELECT
    level + 1,
    REPEAT('* ', level + 1) AS stars
FROM
    starpattern
WHERE
    level < 20
```
- **`level + 1`:** Moves to the next row.
- **`REPEAT('* ', level + 1)`:** Adds one more star to the pattern for each new row.
- **`level < 20`:** Stops recursion at the 20th row (can be adjusted for other values of `R`).

### Step 3: Combine and Output the Pattern
Finally, select all rows from the CTE to display the generated star pattern:
```sql
SELECT
    stars
FROM
    starpattern;
```

## Key Concepts
### 1. **Recursive CTEs**
- Recursive Common Table Expressions allow you to define a query that refers to itself.
- In this query, the recursion generates rows iteratively, each with an incremented `level` and updated star pattern.

### 2. **String Manipulation with REPEAT**
- The `REPEAT` function repeats a given string a specified number of times.
- Example:
  - `REPEAT('* ', 3)` generates `* * * `.

### 3. **Ensuring Data Type Consistency**
- `CAST(... AS CHAR(1000))` ensures that the `stars` column can accommodate large strings as `level` increases.

---

## Customization
### Adjust the Number of Rows
To change the number of rows, modify the `level < 20` condition in the recursive query:
```sql
WHERE
    level < R
```
Replace `R` with the desired number of rows.

### Example for R = 10
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE starpattern AS (
    SELECT
        1 AS level,
        CAST(REPEAT('* ', 1) AS CHAR(1000)) AS stars
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        level + 1,
        REPEAT('* ', level + 1) AS stars
    FROM
        starpattern
    WHERE
        level < 10
)
SELECT
    stars
FROM
    starpattern;
```

## Example Walkthrough
### Input:
- **R = 5**

### Execution:
1. **Base Case:**
   - Row 1: `* `
2. **Recursive Steps:**
   - Row 2: `* * `
   - Row 3: `* * * `
   - Row 4: `* * * * `
   - Row 5: `* * * * * `

### Output:
```plaintext
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

## Notes
- The pattern generation relies on the `REPEAT` function and recursion.
- Ensure your database supports recursive CTEs (e.g., MySQL 8.0+, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).

## Applications
This query can be adapted for various use cases such as:
1. Generating text-based patterns for visualization.
2. Teaching recursion and string manipulation in SQL.
3. Building dynamic reports or dashboards with repetitive patterns.

## Conclusion
The star pattern `P(R)` generator demonstrates the power of recursive CTEs and string functions in SQL. By understanding and customizing this query, you can efficiently generate patterns and learn key concepts in SQL recursion.
