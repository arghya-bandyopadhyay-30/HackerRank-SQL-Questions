# Generate Student Grades Report

## Problem Statement
You are given two tables:
1. **Students**: Contains information about students with the following columns:
   - `ID` (integer): Unique identifier for the student.
   - `Name` (string): Name of the student.
   - `Marks` (integer): Marks obtained by the student.

2. **Grades**: Contains information about grade ranges with the following columns:
   - `Grade` (integer): The grade level.
   - `Min_Mark` (integer): The minimum mark required for the grade.
   - `Max_Mark` (integer): The maximum mark allowed for the grade.

Write an SQL query to generate a report containing the columns: `Name`, `Grade`, and `Marks`. The report must satisfy the following requirements:
1. **Filter Names**: Exclude student names for grades less than 8 and replace them with `"NULL"`.
2. **Sort by Grade**:
   - Students with grades â‰¥ 8: Sort in descending order of `Grade`, and for the same grade, sort alphabetically by `Name`.
   - Students with grades < 8: Sort in descending order of `Grade`, and for the same grade, sort by `Marks` in ascending order.
