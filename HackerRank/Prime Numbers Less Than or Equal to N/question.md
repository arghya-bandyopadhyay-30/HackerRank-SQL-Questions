# Print All Prime Numbers Less Than or Equal to N

## Problem Statement
Write an SQL query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to \( N \). The result should:
1. Contain all prime numbers on a **single line**.
2. Use the ampersand (`&`) character as the separator between prime numbers.

### Example
For \( N = 10 \), the output should be:
```
2&3&5&7
```

Find the output when \( N = 1000 \)
