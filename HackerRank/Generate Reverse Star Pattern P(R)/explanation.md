# Generating Star Pattern P(R) Using SQL Recursion

This document explains how to generate the star pattern `P(R)` using a recursive SQL query. The pattern consists of rows of stars, starting with `R` stars in the first row and decrementing by one star in each subsequent row until only one star remains. Below, the query and its explanation are provided step by step.

---

## Step 1: Define the Base Case
The recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) begins with the first row of the pattern, which contains `R` stars.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT
    20 AS Level,
    REPEAT('* ', 20) AS Stars
```

### What It Does:
1. Initializes the recursion with the maximum row level (`R`, set to 20 in this example).
2. Generates the string of stars for the first row using the `REPEAT` function.

### Output of Base Case:
| Level | Stars                |
|-------|----------------------|
| 20    | * * * * * ... * * * |

---

## Step 2: Recursive Step
Use recursion to generate subsequent rows, each containing one star less than the previous row.

### Query:
```sql
UNION ALL
SELECT
    Level - 1,
    REPEAT('* ', Level - 1) AS Stars
FROM
    StarPattern
WHERE
    Level > 1
```

### What It Does:
1. Decrements the `Level` by 1 for each recursive call.
2. Generates the string of stars for the current row using `REPEAT('* ', Level - 1)`.
3. Stops recursion when `Level = 1` (last row).

### Recursive Example (for `R = 5`):
| Level | Stars   |
|-------|---------|
| 4     | * * * * |
| 3     | * * *   |
| 2     | * *     |
| 1     | *       |

---

## Step 3: Combine and Output the Pattern
Finally, select all rows generated by the CTE and return the `Stars` column.

### Query:
```sql
SELECT
    Stars
FROM
    StarPattern
```

---

## Complete SQL Query
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE StarPattern AS (
    SELECT
        20 AS Level,
        REPEAT('* ', 20) AS Stars
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        Level - 1,
        REPEAT('* ', Level - 1) AS Stars
    FROM
        StarPattern
    WHERE
        Level > 1
)
SELECT
    Stars
FROM
    StarPattern;
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:
`R = 20`

### Execution:
1. **Base Case**: Generate the first row: `Row 20` → `* * * * ... * (20 stars)`.
2. **Recursive Steps**:
   - `Row 19` → `* * * ... * (19 stars)`.
   - `Row 18` → `* * * ... * (18 stars)`.
   - ...
   - `Row 1` → `*`.

### Output:
```
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```

## Explanation of Functions Used

### `WITH RECURSIVE`
Defines a recursive CTE, which allows you to write queries that reference themselves.

### `REPEAT(string, count)`
Repeats the specified string (`'* '`) for the specified number of times (`count`).

---

## Notes:
1. The maximum recursion depth can be adjusted based on your SQL server configuration. In this example, `R` is set to 20.
2. Ensure the database supports recursive CTEs (e.g., MySQL 8.0+, PostgreSQL).

## Use Cases:
- Generating pyramid or triangle patterns for educational and visualization purposes.
- Demonstrating recursion in SQL queries.
