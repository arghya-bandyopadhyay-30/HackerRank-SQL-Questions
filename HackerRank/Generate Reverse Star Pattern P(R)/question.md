# Generate Star Pattern P(R)

## Problem Statement
Write an SQL query to generate a star pattern `P(R)` for a given number of rows `R`. The pattern should consist of `R` rows, where:
1. The first row contains `R` stars.
2. Each subsequent row contains one star less than the previous row.

For example, for `R = 5`, the pattern is:
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*

Write a query to print the pattern P(20).
