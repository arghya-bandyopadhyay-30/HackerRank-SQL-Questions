# Detailed Explanation of the SQL Query

## Step 1: Understanding the Data

Given table `Projects`:

| Task_ID | Start_Date | End_Date   |
|---------|------------|------------|
| 1       | 2015-10-01  | 2015-10-02  |
| 2       | 2015-10-02  | 2015-10-03  |
| 3       | 2015-10-03  | 2015-10-04  |
| 4       | 2015-10-13  | 2015-10-14  |
| 5       | 2015-10-14  | 2015-10-15  |
| 6       | 2015-10-28  | 2015-10-29  |
| 7       | 2015-10-30  | 2015-10-31  |

## Step 2: Breaking Down the Solution

### Part 1: Identifying Consecutive Tasks

```sql
WITH project_with_id AS (
    SELECT
        p1.*,
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN p1.end_date = p2.start_date THEN 0
                ELSE 1
            END
        ) OVER(ORDER BY p1.start_date DESC) AS project_id
    FROM
        Projects p1
    LEFT JOIN
        Projects p2
    ON
        p1.end_date = p2.start_date
)
```

#### Explanation:

- **Self-Join:** The table `Projects` is joined with itself to check if the `end_date` of one task matches the `start_date` of another.
- **CASE Expression:**
  - If a task continues consecutively (i.e., `p1.end_date = p2.start_date`), assign it to the same project (0).
  - Otherwise, increment the `project_id` by 1.
- **Window Function:**
  - `SUM` accumulates project IDs based on descending date order (`ORDER BY p1.start_date DESC`), ensuring that the latest tasks are processed first.

#### Intermediate result:

| Task_ID | Start_Date | End_Date   | project_id |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| 7       | 2015-10-30  | 2015-10-31  | 1          |
| 6       | 2015-10-28  | 2015-10-29  | 2          |
| 5       | 2015-10-14  | 2015-10-15  | 3          |
| 4       | 2015-10-13  | 2015-10-14  | 3          |
| 3       | 2015-10-03  | 2015-10-04  | 4          |
| 2       | 2015-10-02  | 2015-10-03  | 4          |
| 1       | 2015-10-01  | 2015-10-02  | 4          |

### Part 2: Finding Start and End Dates

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(start_date) AS start_date,
    MAX(end_date) AS end_date
FROM
    project_with_id
GROUP BY
    project_id
ORDER BY
    COUNT(*) ASC,
    start_date ASC;
```

#### Explanation:

- **Grouping:** Group rows by `project_id`.
- **Sorting:**
  - First, order projects by duration (`COUNT(*) ASC`).
  - Then, order by the earliest `start_date`.

## Step 3: Final Output

| Start_Date | End_Date   |
|------------|------------|
| 2015-10-28  | 2015-10-29  |
| 2015-10-30  | 2015-10-31  |
| 2015-10-13  | 2015-10-15  |
| 2015-10-01  | 2015-10-04  |

## Step 4: Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Handling Single-Day Projects:** Ensure they are treated as separate projects.
2. **Handling Gaps Between Projects:** Non-consecutive dates should not be grouped together.
3. **Handling Large Datasets:** The query should perform well with proper indexing on `start_date` and `end_date`.
