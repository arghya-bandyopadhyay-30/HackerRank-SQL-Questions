# Detailed Explanation: Sum of Odd and Even Transactions by Date

---

## Step 1: Understanding the Input Data

Consider the following transactions table:

| transaction_id | amount | transaction_date |
|----------------|--------|------------------|
| 1              | 150    | 2024-07-01        |
| 2              | 200    | 2024-07-01        |
| 3              | 75     | 2024-07-01        |
| 4              | 300    | 2024-07-02        |
| 5              | 50     | 2024-07-02        |
| 6              | 120    | 2024-07-03        |

## Step 2: SQL Query Breakdown

```sql
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN amount % 2 = 1 THEN amount 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS odd_sum,
    SUM(CASE 
            WHEN amount % 2 = 0 THEN amount 
            ELSE 0 
        END) AS even_sum
FROM
    transactions
GROUP BY
    transaction_date
ORDER BY
    transaction_date;
```

### Breakdown of Query Steps:

1. **Grouping by transaction_date:**
   - All transactions are grouped based on their transaction_date.

2. **Using CASE inside SUM to calculate sums:**
   - The CASE statement checks whether the amount is odd or even.
   - The sum is calculated accordingly.

3. **Sorting the result:**
   - The ORDER BY transaction_date ensures the output is sorted chronologically.

## Step 3: Expected Output

| transaction_date | odd_sum | even_sum |
|------------------|---------|----------|
| 2024-07-01       | 75      | 350      |
| 2024-07-02       | 0       | 350      |
| 2024-07-03       | 0       | 120      |

## Step 4: Edge Cases Considered

1. **If there are no transactions for a day:**
   - That date should not appear in the output.

2. **If all transactions are odd or even:**
   - The query should handle missing values correctly and return 0.

3. **Ordering of the output:**
   - Ensures the output follows chronological order.
