# Detailed Explanation: Identifying Students with Improvement

---

## Step 1: Input Data

Consider the `Scores` table:

| student_id | subject  | score | exam_date  |
|------------|----------|-------|------------|
| 101        | Math     | 70    | 2023-01-15  |
| 101        | Math     | 85    | 2023-02-15  |
| 101        | Physics  | 65    | 2023-01-15  |
| 101        | Physics  | 60    | 2023-02-15  |
| 102        | Math     | 80    | 2023-01-15  |
| 102        | Math     | 85    | 2023-02-15  |

## Step 2: Understanding the Query Execution

### Step 2.1: Calculating First and Latest Exam Dates

Using the window function:

| student_id | subject | score | exam_date  | first_exam | latest_exam |
|------------|---------|-------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 101        | Math    | 70    | 2023-01-15  | 2023-01-15  | 2023-02-15   |
| 101        | Math    | 85    | 2023-02-15  | 2023-01-15  | 2023-02-15   |
| 101        | Physics | 65    | 2023-01-15  | 2023-01-15  | 2023-02-15   |

### Step 2.2: Aggregation and Condition Checking

After applying conditions:

| student_id | subject  | first_score | latest_score |
|------------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 101        | Math     | 70          | 85           |

---

## Step 3: Output and Ordering

Final output sorted by `student_id` and `subject`.

---

## Step 4: Edge Cases Considered

1. **Students with only one exam:**
   - Should not appear in the final result.
2. **Students who have not improved:**
   - Should not appear in the final result.
3. **Students with multiple subjects:**
   - Each subject is considered separately.

## Step 5: Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of rows, due to window functions and sorting.
2. **Space Complexity:** O(n), as we use a CTE to store intermediate results.

## Conclusion

The query correctly identifies students who have shown improvement by comparing their earliest and latest scores.
