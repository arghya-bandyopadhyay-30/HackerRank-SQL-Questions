# Explanation: Breaking Down the Query to Unpivot Store Prices

This document explains the SQL query used to transform the `store1`, `store2`, and `store3` columns into a unified format using the `UNION` operator.

---

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### **Step 1: Structure of the Query**

The query consists of three `SELECT` statements combined using `UNION` to merge results.

Each `SELECT` statement retrieves:

1. `product_id` from the table.
2. A hardcoded string (`'store1'`, `'store2'`, `'store3'`) to represent the store name.
3. The price from the respective store column.

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' AS store, store1 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL

UNION

SELECT product_id, 'store2' AS store, store2 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL

UNION

SELECT product_id, 'store3' AS store, store3 AS price
FROM Products
WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Step 2: Handling NULL Values**

- The `WHERE storeX IS NOT NULL` clause ensures that rows with `NULL` prices are excluded from the result.

## Step 3: Combining Results

The `UNION` operator merges the results from each store while removing duplicate rows.

## Example Execution

### **Input Data:**

| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |

### **Intermediate Steps:**

#### **Store 1 Query Output:**

| product_id | store  | price |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |

#### **Store 2 Query Output:**

| product_id | store  | price |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 0          | store2 | 100   |

#### **Store 3 Query Output:**

| product_id | store  | price |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |

### **Final Output:**

| product_id | store  | price |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |

## Advantages

1. **Easy to Understand and Implement:**
   - Simple query structure that effectively handles unpivoting.

2. **Handles Missing Values:**
   - The `WHERE` clause ensures that null prices are excluded.

---

## Disadvantages

1. **Repeated Code:**
   - Each store column requires a separate `SELECT` statement, leading to redundancy.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Performance may degrade as the number of store columns increases.

## Potential Optimization

For a large number of stores, consider using SQL techniques such as:

- **Dynamic SQL generation** to automate column handling.
- **Pivot functions** (if supported by the database) to achieve better scalability and performance.
