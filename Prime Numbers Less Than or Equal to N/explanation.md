# Explanation for Finding and Formatting Prime Numbers

This document explains a SQL query that generates all prime numbers less than or equal to a given number N, using recursion and subqueries. The result is formatted as a single line, with the ampersand (`&`) character as the separator.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Prime Numbers**
   - A prime number is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
   - To check if a number `n` is prime:
     - Ensure that no number `d` in the range from 2 to `SQRT(n)` divides `n` evenly.

### 2. **Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
   - Used to generate a sequence of numbers from 2 to N.
   - Allows iterative processing of numbers up to a specified limit.

### 3. **Subqueries**
   - Check whether a number `n` is divisible by any number `d` in the range from 2 to `SQRT(n)`.
   - If no divisor exists, `n` is identified as prime.

### 4. **String Aggregation**
   - The `GROUP_CONCAT` function (or equivalent) combines all prime numbers into a single string, separated by `&`.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Step 1: Generate a Sequence of Numbers

We use a recursive CTE named `Numbers` to create a sequence of integers from 2 to N.

**Query:**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE Numbers AS (
    SELECT
        2 AS num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        num + 1
    FROM
        Numbers
    WHERE
        num < 1000 -- Replace 1000 with your upper limit, N
)
```

**Explanation:**
- Starts with the base case: `num = 2`.
- Recursively increments `num` by 1 until the specified limit N is reached.

**Output:**
| num |
|-----|
| 2   |
| 3   |
| 4   |
| ... |
| 1000|

### Step 2: Filter Prime Numbers

We create another CTE named `PrimeCheck` to filter out non-prime numbers from the `Numbers` CTE.

**Query:**
```sql
PrimeCheck AS (
    SELECT
        num
    FROM
        Numbers n
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT
            1
        FROM
            Numbers d
        WHERE
            d.num <= FLOOR(SQRT(n.num))     -- Check divisors up to SQRT(n)
            AND n.num % d.num = 0           -- Check divisibility
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**
- For each number `n`:
  - Check whether there exists a divisor `d` such that `d` is less than or equal to `FLOOR(SQRT(n))` and `n % d = 0`.
  - If no such divisor exists, `n` is prime.

**Example (for `n = 7`):**
- Check divisors `d = 2` (since `SQRT(7)` is approximately 2.6):
  - `7 % 2 != 0`: No divisors exist.
- Conclusion: `n = 7` is prime.

### Step 3: Concatenate Prime Numbers with `&`

Finally, aggregate all prime numbers into a single line using the `GROUP_CONCAT` function.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT
    GROUP_CONCAT(num SEPARATOR '&') AS PrimeNumbers
FROM
    PrimeCheck;
```

**Explanation:**
- Aggregates all prime numbers into a single line.
- Uses `&` as the separator.

**Example Output:**
- For N = 10, the output is: `2&3&5&7`

## Final Query

Here’s the complete SQL query:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE Numbers AS (
    SELECT
        2 AS num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        num + 1
    FROM
        Numbers
    WHERE
        num <= 1000 -- Replace with your desired limit N
),
PrimeCheck AS (
    SELECT
        num
    FROM
        Numbers n
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT
            1
        FROM
            Numbers d
        WHERE
            d.num <= FLOOR(SQRT(n.num))     -- Check divisors up to SQRT(n)
            AND n.num % d.num = 0           -- Check divisibility
    )
)
SELECT
    GROUP_CONCAT(num SEPARATOR '&') AS PrimeNumbers
FROM
    PrimeCheck;
```

## Example Walkthrough

### Input
- N = 10

### Execution

1. **Generate Numbers**:
   - Sequence: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`.

2. **Filter Prime Numbers**:
   - Check divisors for each number:
     - `2` → Prime.
     - `3` → Prime.
     - `4` → Not Prime (divisible by `2`).
     - `5` → Prime.
     - `6` → Not Prime (divisible by `2`).
     - `7` → Prime.
     - `8` → Not Prime (divisible by `2`).
     - `9` → Not Prime (divisible by `3`).
     - `10` → Not Prime (divisible by `2`).
   - Primes: `2, 3, 5, 7`.

3. **Concatenate Primes**:
   - Result: `2&3&5&7`.

This query efficiently generates and formats prime numbers up to N, providing a simple and scalable solution for finding prime numbers in SQL.
