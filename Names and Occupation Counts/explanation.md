# Explanation for Query: Names and Occupation Counts

## Concepts Involved
1. **String Manipulation**:
   - `CONCAT()`: Combines strings.
   - `LEFT(OCCUPATION, 1)`: Extracts the first character of the occupation.
   - `LOWER(OCCUPATION)`: Converts the occupation to lowercase.

2. **Grouping and Aggregation**:
   - `COUNT()`: Counts occurrences of each occupation.
   - `GROUP BY OCCUPATION`: Groups rows by each unique occupation.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Alphabetical sorting for names.
   - Count-based and alphabetical sorting for occupation counts.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - `UNION`: Combines two queries into one result set.

5. **Ordering Results**:
   - The `ORDER BY` clause ensures both queries' results are sorted together.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Query

### Step 1: Generate the List of Names with Initials
- Use `CONCAT(NAME, "(", LEFT(OCCUPATION, 1), ")")` to create the desired format for names.
- Sort the names alphabetically.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(NAME, "(", LEFT(OCCUPATION, 1), ")") AS Result
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY NAME;
```

### Step 2: Count and Format Occupations
- Use `COUNT(OCCUPATION)` to count the occurrences of each occupation.
- Use `LOWER(OCCUPATION)` to format the occupation name in lowercase.

Combine the count and occupation into the desired string format:
`There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.`

```sql
SELECT CONCAT("There are a total of ", COUNT(OCCUPATION), " ", LOWER(OCCUPATION), "s.") AS Result
FROM OCCUPATIONS
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), OCCUPATION;
```

### Step 3: Combine the Results
- Use `UNION ALL` to combine both queries.
- Use `ORDER BY` Result to sort the combined results.

#### Note: 
- We can use ORDER BY in UNION ALL or UNION, but onlyat the end of the entire query, not within the subqueries.
- Applying ORDER BY inside subquery is either ignored (PostgreSQL) or cause errors (MySQL) because the order of intermediate results doesn't matter for combining purpose.

```sql
(
    SELECT CONCAT(NAME, "(", LEFT(OCCUPATION, 1), ")") AS Result
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    -- ORDER BY NAME;
)
UNION ALL
(
    SELECT CONCAT("There are a total of ", COUNT(OCCUPATION), " ", LOWER(OCCUPATION), "s.") AS Result
    FROM OCCUPATIONS
    GROUP BY OCCUPATION
    -- ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION), OCCUPATION;
)
ORDER BY Result;
```
